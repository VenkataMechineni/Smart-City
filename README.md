# Smart City Public Transportation Project

# Executive Summary:
Our Smart City Public Transportation project is a groundbreaking initiative aimed at revolutionizing urban transportation systems. This comprehensive report delves into the core problem statement, provides a detailed overview of our innovative solution, and offers in-depth explanations of the code implementation, drawing extensively from the solution report.

# Problem Statement:
In the urban transportation landscape, challenges such as congestion, environmental sustainability concerns, and a lack of real-time information have emerged as critical obstacles. Our project addresses these issues by specifically focusing on the lack of real-time information in existing public transportation systems, aiming to reduce inefficiencies, minimize commute times, and enhance overall commuter satisfaction.

# Solution Overview:
Our multifaceted solution comprises exploratory data analysis, various clustering techniques (KMeans, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, GMM, Agglomerative), and the development of a Flask application. The project's high-level architecture integrates data collection, processing, communication, decision support, user interface, and security layers.
